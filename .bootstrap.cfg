# To customise your bootstrap configuration, create a copy of this file without
# the '.sample' extension, simply uncomment the relevant header (common/3rdparty)
# and the fields that you wish to customise. Any fields that remain commented out
# will use their default values, so it is only necessary to uncomment a line
# if you wish to change something.
